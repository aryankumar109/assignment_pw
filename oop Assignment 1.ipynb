    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, i.e., the class. It allows the class to control the access to its data, preventing direct manipulation from outside. Instead, external interactions occur through well-defined methods, which ensures data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of simplifying complex systems by representing only the essential features while hiding the unnecessary details. In OOP, abstraction is achieved by defining abstract classes and interfaces, which serve as templates for other classes. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and provide a blueprint for other classes to inherit from, while interfaces define a contract that classes must follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent or superclass). The child class can extend and specialize the functionality of the parent class while retaining its own unique characteristics. Inheritance promotes code reusability and hierarchy in the class structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent multiple types, allowing flexibility and extensibility in the code. Polymorphism is achieved through method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) and method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass to provide a different implementation). This feature simplifies code maintenance and enhances flexibility."
