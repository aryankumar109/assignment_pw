    "Abstraction is one of the four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP). It is the process of simplifying complex systems by representing only the essential features while hiding the unnecessary details. In other words, abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. It provides a high-level view of an object, making it easier to understand and use, without worrying about the internal implementation."
