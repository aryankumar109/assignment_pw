    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of code. When an exception is raised, it usually indicates that something unexpected or erroneous has occurred, and the program cannot proceed as intended. Exceptions provide a way to handle and recover from errors gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be raised in various situations, such as when trying to divide by zero, accessing an index out of range in a list, or attempting to open a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nature of Error:\n",
    "   - **Syntax Error:** Syntax errors are encountered during the parsing of the code, before the program starts executing. They occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language grammar. These errors are typically caused by typos, incorrect indentation, missing parentheses, etc. Since the code cannot even be compiled properly, a syntax error prevents the program from running.\n",
    "   - **Exception:** Exceptions occur during the execution of the program when an unexpected situation or error occurs. These can include situations like division by zero, trying to access an index that doesn't exist, or attempting to perform an operation on incompatible data types. Unlike syntax errors, exceptions are encountered at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Detection:\n",
    "   - **Syntax Error:** Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before any code execution occurs. The interpreter checks the code for correct syntax and structure.\n",
    "   - **Exception:** Exceptions are detected during runtime when the code is actually being executed. They arise when the program encounters situations that it cannot handle or proceed with normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling:\n",
    "   - **Syntax Error:** Since syntax errors prevent the code from being executed at all, they need to be fixed in the source code before the program can be run.\n",
    "   - **Exception:** Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks. This allows you to anticipate potential errors, capture them when they occur, and take appropriate actions to recover from them without crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Examples:\n",
    "   - **Syntax Error:** print hello world (missing parentheses around print  statement)\n",
    "   - **Exception:** 10/0 (division by zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, syntax errors are mistakes in the code's structure that prevent the program from being executed, while exceptions are runtime errors that occur during program execution due to unexpected situations, and they can be caught and handled using try-except blocks."

After displaying the traceback, the program exits.\n",
